Implementing malware concept using python

Don't try this code in the folder which has valuable information.
This will encrypt every file type like txt,png,jpg,pdf,etc..
Don't use this to harm anyone

This contain two files:
  encrypter.py
  decrypter.py
  
The encrpyter file encrypte all the file in the certain folder.
Except three files:
  encrypter.py
  decrypter.py
  thekey.key
  
If twice encrpytion file run then the original file cannot be retrived.
Since for everytime a new key will be generated.

Don't use this to harm anyone.
Without proper idea of this code.This will be harmful.


The name of this three files should not be changed.Because it will also encrypt the encrypt and decrypt files too.
